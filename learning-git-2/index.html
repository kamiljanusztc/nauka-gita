        <p>Thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder<br>
        I was caught<br>
        In the middle of a railroad track<br>
        I looked round<br>
        And I knew there was no turning back<br>
        My mind raced<br>
        And I thought what could I do<br>
        And I knew<br>
        There was no help, no help from you<br>
        Sound of the drums<br>
        Beating in my heart<br>
        The thunder of guns<br>
        Tore me apart<br>

        Broke the limit, we hit the town<br>
        Went through to Texas, yeah Texas, and we had some fun<br>
        We met some girls<br>
        Some dancers who gave a good time<br>
        Broke all the rules<br>
        Played all the foolsv
        Yeah yeah they, they, they blew our minds<br>
        And I was shaking at the knees<br>
